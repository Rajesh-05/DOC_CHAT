# Doc_chat

## Introduction
Doc_chat is an advanced question-answering system that leverages the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Groq's llama3 as a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide precise and contextually relevant answers.

## Features
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Combines the benefits of pre-trained language models with external knowledge retrieval to generate informative responses.
- **Groq's llama3 Integration**: Utilizes the computational efficiency and scalability of Groq's llama3 as the underlying LLM.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle increasing loads and complex queries with ease.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interaction flow for end-users.
